            Every Tuesday morning, 16 games will be chosen from an online site. The games and the 'opening lines' will be posted to the website. 
            These lines are subject to change, due to injuries and the like. On Thursday, final lines will be distributed. These are the official 
            lines used to place your bets. All bets for the week must be in by 12pm CST on Friday. Occasionally there is a worthwhile Thursday 
            night game. If it is a selected game and you choose to bet on it, ALL your bets for the week must be in by Thursday 4pm.
